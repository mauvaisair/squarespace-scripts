## IDEAS

- ### Image Slider
    #### To let the user see a flash turned into a tattoo

    ##### Before & after of a flash & its respective tattoo:
    - On the left: image of a flash
    - On the right: image of the tattooed flash
    - A line separates the two images, showing only half of each
    
    Moving the line either lets the user see the whole flash or the whole tattoo
    
- ### Dynamic Price Estimate
    #### To let the user figure out roughly how much their tattoo could cost

    ##### The price estimate shown updates dynamically in function of: 
    - Detail slider: The level of detail
    - Size Slider: The size of the drawing
    
    #### The sliders' values are visually represented by dynamically updating elements:
    - Detail slider: 5 versions of the same tattoo design. 
        Between each version, there are noticeable incrementations in the level of detail. 
    - Size slider: A ruler on the side of the image. 
        The image size doesn't change: the ruler sclaes in it's measures' proportions.
